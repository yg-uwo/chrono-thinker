INSTRUCTIONS FOR RENAMING MAINLEVEL TO LEVEL1
============================================

Follow these steps to rename your MainLevel scene to Level1:

1. ENSURE UNITY IS NOT RUNNING THE SCENE
   - Close Play mode if it's active
   - Make sure you have saved all your changes

2. RENAME THE SCENE FILE
   - In the Project window, navigate to Assets/Scenes
   - Right-click on "MainLevel.unity"
   - Select "Rename"
   - Change the name to "Level1.unity"
   - Press Enter to confirm

3. UPDATE BUILD SETTINGS
   - Go to File > Build Settings
   - If "MainLevel" is in the Scenes In Build list, remove it
   - Add the newly renamed "Level1" scene
   - Make sure the scenes are in the correct order (MainMenu as scene 0, Level1 as scene 1)
   - Click "Apply"

4. CHECK FOR REMAINING REFERENCES
   - The MainMenuController script has been updated to reference "Level1" instead of "MainLevel"
   - If you created any custom scripts that reference "MainLevel" directly, update them

5. TEST THE GAME
   - Play the game from the MainMenu scene
   - Verify that clicking "Start" correctly loads Level1
   - Make sure level transitions work if you have multiple levels

6. OPTIONAL: UPDATE THE FOLDER
   - If you also have a "MainLevel" folder in your Scenes directory, you may want to rename it
   - Right-click on the "MainLevel" folder and select "Rename"
   - Change it to "Level1" for consistency

Note: Unity will handle updating references in the scene automatically, but manual references
in scripts need to be updated separately (which we've done for MainMenuController).
