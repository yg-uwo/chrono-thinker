UNDERSTANDING TEXTMESHPRO MATERIALS
=================================

TextMeshPro's material system can be confusing because it works differently than most Unity components. 
Here's an explanation of what you're seeing and how our solution works:

WHY YOU SEE "LIBERATIONSANS SDF MATERIAL"
----------------------------------------
What you're seeing in the inspector is not a separate component - it's a reference to the default 
font material that all TextMeshPro elements use. This reference appears in the inspector under the 
TextMeshPro component as:

- Font Asset: LiberationSans SDF
- Material Preset: LiberationSans SDF Material

HOW TEXTMESHPRO MATERIALS WORK
-----------------------------
TextMeshPro has TWO material references:

1. SHARED MATERIAL (fontSharedMaterial):
   - This is like a template that all text elements with the same font use
   - Changes to this affect ALL text elements using this material
   
2. INSTANCE MATERIAL (fontMaterial):
   - This is supposed to be a unique instance for this specific text element
   - However, TextMeshPro may still revert to the shared material in certain situations

THE ISSUE: MATERIAL PRIORITY
---------------------------
The reason you still see "LiberationSans SDF Material" is because:

1. TextMeshPro always shows the name of the original material in the inspector
2. If you change the color in the inspector, it modifies the shared material
3. This affects all other text elements using the same material

OUR SOLUTION: HOW TMPUniqueMaterial WORKS
---------------------------------------
The improved TMPUniqueMaterial script:

1. Creates a completely new material instance based on the font's material
2. Sets BOTH the shared and instance material references to our unique material
3. Applies the color directly to both the text component AND the material
4. Does this in both Awake() and Start() to ensure other scripts don't override it

WHY THIS WORKS
-------------
By setting both material references, we ensure that:
1. TextMeshPro won't revert to the shared material
2. Color changes only affect this specific text element
3. The material is properly isolated from other text elements

WHAT YOU'LL STILL SEE IN THE INSPECTOR
------------------------------------
You'll still see "LiberationSans SDF Material" in the inspector because TextMeshPro 
shows the ORIGINAL material name rather than our unique instance name.

However, if you check "Debug Mode" in the TextMeshPro component, you may see the 
actual material name which should be something like "YourObjectName_UniqueMaterial".

The important thing is that the color will now work independently, even if the 
inspector still shows the original material name.
