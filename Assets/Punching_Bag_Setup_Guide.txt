Punching Bag Mechanic Setup Guide
==============================

This guide will help you set up the punching bag mechanic in your game. Follow these steps to implement the feature.

1. ENEMY HEALTH SETUP
---------------------
- Add the EnemyHealth component to all enemy prefabs
- Create a health bar prefab:
  a. Create a new UI Canvas (World Space)
  b. Add a Slider object to the canvas
  c. Configure the Slider with a fill image (red color recommended)
  d. Set the RectTransform to a small size (e.g., 80x10 pixels)
  e. Make sure the Slider has Min Value = 0 and Max Value = 1
  f. Create a prefab from this Slider
- Assign the health bar prefab to the EnemyHealth component

2. PUNCHING BAG SETUP
---------------------
- Create a new GameObject for the punching bag:
  a. Use the "PunchingBagWithAnchor" prefab in the Prefabs folder
  - OR -
  b. Follow these manual steps if needed:
     1. Create a parent GameObject "PunchingBagWithAnchor"
     2. Add an Anchor child ("PunchingBag_Anchor") with a Static Rigidbody2D
     3. Add a PunchingBag child with:
        - SpriteRenderer (with appropriate sprite)
        - CircleCollider2D or BoxCollider2D (NOT a trigger)
        - Rigidbody2D (Kinematic, no gravity)
        - PunchingBag script component
     4. Set the PunchingBag script's anchorPoint to reference the Anchor transform
- Make sure the punching bag GameObject is on the "Punchable" layer
- IMPORTANT: The PunchingBag now:
  - Only moves when punched
  - Will recoil past its anchor when hit
  - Properly applies damage and knockback to enemies
  - Ignores physical collisions with players and enemies

3. PLAYER AIMING SETUP
---------------------
- Add the PlayerPunching component to the Player GameObject
- Configure the punchableLayer in PlayerPunching to include the "Punchable" layer
- By default, the player can:
  - Quick punch with left mouse button
  - Charge a stronger punch with right mouse button

4. PUNCHABLE LAYER SETUP
------------------------
- Create a new Layer called "Punchable" in Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layers
- Set the punching bag GameObject to use this layer
- Configure the Player's PlayerPunching component to use this layer mask

5. TESTING THE MECHANIC
-----------------------
- Place punching bags in your level
- Ensure enemies are properly tagged as "Enemy"
- Test the following behaviors:
  - Punching bag only moves when hit
  - Punching bag recoils past anchor when hit
  - Punching bag applies damage and knockback to enemies
  - Punching bag doesn't physically interact with players or enemies
  
If you encounter any issues, check that:
1. The PunchingBag script is properly attached and configured
2. The anchor point is correctly set
3. The layer assignments are correct
4. All required colliders are present and NOT triggers
