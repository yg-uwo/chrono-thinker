# Sound Effects Folder

This folder contains the sound effects used in the game. You should add the following sound files:

1. `Punch.wav` - Sound effect for when a punch lands
2. `Charge.wav` - Sound effect for when the charge bar is charging
3. `PlayerDamage.wav` - Sound effect for when the player takes damage
4. `EnemyDamage.wav` - Sound effect for when an enemy takes damage

## How to Add Sound Files

1. Create or obtain audio files in `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.ogg` format
2. Place them in this folder
3. Make sure they have the exact names listed above
4. Unity will automatically use them in the game

## Sound File Recommendations

- **Punch Sound**: A quick, impactful sound (like a thud or whoosh)
- **Charge Sound**: A rising, energetic sound that works well when looped
- **Player Damage**: A distinct sound that clearly indicates the player is hurt
- **Enemy Damage**: A different sound from the player damage sound
