VICTORY UI SETUP GUIDE
=====================

This guide will help you properly set up the victory panel with working buttons in your game.

STEP 1: UPDATE THE VICTORY PANEL
-----------------------------
1. Open your Level1 scene

2. Find the Victory Panel in the hierarchy:
   - This is likely under a Canvas object
   - If you don't have one, create a Panel GameObject under your Canvas and name it "VictoryPanel"

3. Make sure the Victory Panel has:
   - A Text element showing "Level Complete" and the time
   - A "Next Level" button
   - Optionally, a "Main Menu" button

4. For the Next Level button:
   - Add a Button component if it doesn't have one
   - Set its text to "NEXT LEVEL"
   - Make sure it has a TextMeshPro - Text component for its label
   - Style it to match your game's look

STEP 2: CONNECT THE GAMEUI MANAGER
-------------------------------
1. Find the GameObject with the GameUIManager script attached

2. In the Inspector:
   - Find the "Next Level Button" field in the GameUIManager component
   - Drag your Next Level button from the hierarchy to this field
   - Drag the Victory Panel to the "Victory Panel" field if it's not already set

3. Make sure these other references are set:
   - Victory Time Text: The TextMeshPro element showing the completion time
   - Main Panel: Your Canvas or main UI container
   - Game Timer: Reference to your GameTimer object

STEP 3: MODIFY THE GOAL TRIGGER
----------------------------
The GoalTrigger has been updated to use the UI button instead of automatically loading the next level.

1. Find the GameObject with the GoalTrigger script
   
2. In the Inspector, ensure these fields are set:
   - Next Level Name: "Level2" (for Level1) or appropriate level name
   - Is Final Level: Unchecked for Level1, checked for Level2 (or your final level)
   - Victory Panel: Reference to your victory panel (if used)

STEP 4: TEST THE LEVEL PROGRESSION
-------------------------------
1. Play the game from Level1

2. Complete the level (reach the goal)

3. The Victory Panel should appear with:
   - Your level completion time
   - A "Next Level" button
   - (Optional) A "Main Menu" button

4. Click the "Next Level" button - it should load Level2
   - In the final level, it will say "Main Menu" and return to the main menu

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
If the Next Level button doesn't work:

1. Check the Console for error messages

2. Verify that the button is properly referenced in the GameUIManager

3. Make sure the GoalTrigger has the correct "Next Level Name" set

4. Check that the button has the correct OnClick events (these should be set automatically)

5. Ensure all scenes are added to the Build Settings in the correct order

CUSTOMIZATION
-----------
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the victory UI:

- Change button colors and text styles
- Add animations or effects
- Add additional information like score or stats
- Include sound effects for victory

The victory panel will now wait for the player to click the Next Level button,
giving them time to read the completion message and prepare for the next level.
