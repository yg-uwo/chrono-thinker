SETTING UP LEVELS WITH THE LEVELMANAGER
=====================================

The LevelManager is a unified tool that automatically configures each level with the correct settings.
Follow these steps to set up both Level1 and the new Level2.

PART 1: SET UP LEVEL1
--------------------

1. Open the Level1 scene

2. Create a new empty GameObject:
   - Right-click in the Hierarchy and select Create Empty
   - Name it "LevelManager"

3. Add the LevelManager component:
   - With the LevelManager GameObject selected, click "Add Component" in the Inspector
   - Type "Level Manager" and select it

4. The LevelManager will automatically:
   - Detect it's in Level1
   - Set the timer to 60 seconds
   - Configure the GoalTrigger to point to Level2
   - Set isFinalLevel to false

5. If you want to override any settings:
   - Directly edit the values in the LevelManager component
   - Click the "Apply Level Settings" button to apply your changes

PART 2: CREATE AND SET UP LEVEL2
------------------------------

1. Duplicate Level1:
   - In the Project window, right-click on Level1.unity
   - Select "Duplicate"
   - Rename the new scene to "Level2.unity"

2. Open the Level2 scene

3. Find the LevelManager GameObject:
   - It was copied from Level1, so it should already be in the scene
   - Select it in the Hierarchy

4. Update the LevelManager:
   - Click the "Get Current Scene Name" button in the Inspector to update the level name
   - The LevelManager will automatically apply Level2 presets:
     * Timer: 45 seconds
     * Next Level: Level3 (or configured as final level)
     * Is Final Level: true (unless you're creating more levels)

5. Click "Apply Level Settings" to ensure changes take effect

PART 3: ADD LEVEL2 TO BUILD SETTINGS
----------------------------------

1. Go to File > Build Settings

2. Add Level2 to the Scenes In Build list:
   - Drag Level2.unity from the Project window to the Scenes list
   - Ensure the order is: MainMenu (0), Level1 (1), Level2 (2)

3. Click "Apply"

PART 4: TESTING YOUR LEVELS
-------------------------

1. Play the game from the MainMenu scene

2. Test the following:
   - Level1 should start with a 60-second timer
   - Completing Level1 should load Level2
   - Level2 should start with a 45-second timer
   - Completing Level2 should either end the game or load Level3 if you create it

CUSTOMIZING LEVEL SETTINGS
------------------------

The LevelManager comes with preset configurations, but you can easily override them:

- Timer Duration: Change the "Timer Duration" value in the LevelManager
- Next Level: Set the "Next Level Name" to the scene you want to load
- Final Level: Toggle "Is Final Level" if this is the last level

After changing any setting, click "Apply Level Settings" to update your level.

CREATING ADDITIONAL LEVELS
------------------------

To add more levels (e.g., Level3), follow the same process:

1. Duplicate Level2 and rename to Level3
2. Update the LevelManager with "Get Current Scene Name"
3. Customize settings as needed
4. Add to Build Settings

You can also update the LevelManager.cs script to add presets for new levels in the ApplyLevelPresets() method.
